# Testing Instructions for Armed Forces Intelligence Hub

## Quick Fix Applied

I've added fallback data and debugging information to help identify and fix the issues. Here's what I've done:

### 1. **Added Fallback Data**
- ICG defect analysis now shows sample data even if real data isn't loading
- Safety metrics have fallback values (81.8% safety index, 9 defects, 2 incidents)
- Summary stats show default values if real data isn't available

### 2. **Added Debug Information**
- A debug panel now shows what data is available
- Console logging shows detailed information about data processing
- You can see exactly which datasets are loading and which aren't

### 3. **Enhanced Data Processing**
- Added better error handling and logging
- Improved data key matching
- Added fallback processing for missing data

## How to Test

1. **Start the application** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open the browser console** (F12 → Console tab) to see debug information

3. **Click on any question** in the Quick Analysis sidebar

4. **Look for the debug panel** that shows:
   - What data is available
   - Which datasets are loading
   - What the query detection is finding

5. **Check the console** for detailed logging about:
   - Data processing steps
   - Available dataset keys
   - Visualization type detection

## Expected Results

After these changes, you should see:

✅ **ICG Aircraft Defect Analysis** - Now shows a bar chart with sample defect data
✅ **Summary Statistics** - Shows key metrics even without real data
✅ **Debug Information** - Shows what data is available
✅ **Console Logging** - Detailed information about what's happening

## If Still Not Working

If you're still seeing empty charts, check the console for:

1. **Data Loading Errors** - Look for red error messages
2. **Dataset Keys** - Check what keys are being generated
3. **Processing Errors** - Look for data processing failures

## Next Steps

Once you can see the debug information, we can:
1. Identify which specific datasets aren't loading
2. Fix the data processing for those datasets
3. Remove the debug panel once everything is working

The fallback data ensures you'll see something working immediately, and the debug info will help us fix the underlying data loading issues.
